Prerequisites:

-3 requirements.txt are given 
    -1 for pip(in folder pip command) other for 
    -conda(folder conda command)(not all packages where found in conda as some older packages are used for EAST) 
    -the outdated/orignal(in folder orignal command) one which was cloned from the repo of EAST.

-In OCR.py sys.path.insert is used on line 17 to import some packages for EAST.

-Code was written inside spyder and so is the cell style.


To RUN:

-OCR.py is the main file.

-arguments to parse(line 73 in OCR.py):
    -test_data_path     path to images
    -gpu_list           {0,1,...}
    -Checkpoint_path    /githubEAST/checkpoint/east_icdar2015_resnet_v1_50_rbox 
    -output_dir         path to output directory (image with boxes and text file of location of boxes)
    -no_write_image     default=False do not write on images 

-current has been marked in the cell name when multiple versions of the method exist.

-Spyder has trouble with running tensorflow flags so terminal is preferred.
